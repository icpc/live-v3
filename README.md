# Run release version

* Download release from https://github.com/icpc/live-v3/releases
  * You can download [latest dev build](https://github.com/icpc/live-v3/actions/runs/5968512041) instead if you are brave enough

* Run `java -jar /path/to/jar/file --config-directory=/path/to/config/directory`

  Check for more options by running `java -jar /path/to/jar/file` without arguments. Here is the couple most useful
  * ```--creds=creds.json``` -- The path to the credential file. It can be used to avoid storing credentials in the main config file. 
  * ```--no-auth``` -- Disable auth in admin interface. It's useful if you are running the overlayer on localhost.
  * ```-p 8080``` -- 8080 is default port to listen, but it can be changed.
  * ```--widget-positions=filename``` -- customize positions of each widget, see examples in config/widget_positions.json.*
  * ```--visual-config=filename``` -- customize colors, sizes, captions and other, see examples in config/visualConfig.json.*

* Check [emulation mode](https://github.com/icpc/live-v3/blob/main/docs/emulation.md) part of development doc for testing your setup before the contest started.
* Check [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/icpc/live-v3/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md) is something looks wrong.

# Authorisation

For now http basic auth is used. If you try to login with
user, which does not exist, it will be automatically created.
First created receives admin rights. Others only receive them when
someone with admin rights confirms, it's okay.

Consider, if you are okay with passing your passwords using plain HTTP.

If you don't need auth, you can disable it by `--no-auth` command-line option.
