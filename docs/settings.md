## Config file

Main config should be stored within config directory in `settings.json` or `settings.json5` file.
In some outdated examples legacy `events.properties` format is used instead.

Settings should specify the contest system used and parameters of the contest.
Also, it sometimes contains some abilities to modify received data.

You can use [json schema file](https://github.com/icpc/live-v3/tree/main/schemas/settings.schema.json) in your text editor to get help with writing config. 

[Here](https://icpc.io/live-v3/cds/core/org.icpclive.cds.settings/-c-d-s-settings/index.html) 
is the full list of supported properties for all systems.

Typical config should look like that

```
// settings.json file in your config directory
{
  "type": "cf",
  "apiKey": "$creds.cf_api_key",
  "apiSecret": "$creds.cf_api_secret",
  "contestId": 1600,
  "emulation": { "speed": 10, "startTime": "2023-08-24 22:43"}, // remove this if you don't need emulation
}
// creds.json file somewhere else passed with --creds option
{
  "cf_api_key": "YOUR CODEFORCES API KEY",
  "cf_api_secret": "YOUR CODEFORCES API SECRET",
}
```

Other contest systems have different arguments than apiKey/apiSecret/contestId but the main idea is the same.

## Providing authorization credentials

Whenever you need to put some url in config, you can put it in several ways:

* As just a string. Then it would be interpreted as url, if it starts with `http://` or `https://`,
  otherwise, it would be interpreted as local file, which is useful for testing.
* As an object with url, login, and password
* As an object with url and full [auth](https://icpc.io/live-v3/cds/core/org.icpclive.cds.settings/-auth/index.html) object.

A separate creds file is needed to avoid accidental publishing of your keys. 
If you don't plan to publish a config file, you can just put the key into it instead of a separate file.

For example:

```
// settings.json with just an url
{
  "type": "pcms",
  "url": "https://nerc.itmo.ru/archive/2023/standings.xml"
}
// settings.json with url, requiring password stored in creds file
{
  "type": "pcms",
  "url": {
    "url": "https://nerc.itmo.ru/archive/2023/standings.xml",
    "login": "login",
    "password": "$creds.password"
  }
}
// settings.json with url, requiring password stored right here, cookie and a special header
{
    "type": "pcms",
    "url": {
        "url": "https://nerc.itmo.ru/archive/2023/standings.xml",
        "auth": {
            "basic": {
                "login": "login",
                "password": "password"
            },
            "cookies": {"auth_cookie_name": "cookie_value"},
            "headers": {"Authorization": "OAuth token"}
        }
    }
}
```
