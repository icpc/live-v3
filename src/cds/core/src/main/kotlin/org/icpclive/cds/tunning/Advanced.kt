 * This class represents possible contest configuration overrides.

 *
 * This class contains the data to be fixed in what is received from a contest system.
 *
 * The order in which overrides applied:
 *   * Time and scoreboard related (they don't interact with others)
 *   * Filtering out non-submitted teams if requested
 *   * Regexp overrides by team name (so values provided by them can be used in templates)
 *   * Regexp overrides by team id (so values provided by them can be used in templates)
 *   * Creating new groups mentioned in teams or overrides and group overrides
 *   * Creating new organizations mentioned in teams or overrides and organization overrides
 *   * Custom fields from team overrides (so values provided by them can be used in templates)
 *   * (Deprecated) Team media template
 *   * Team override template
 *   * Normal team overrides
 *
 * In all templates in all strings inside `{variableName}` pattern is substituted.
 * The following variable names are supported:
 *   * teamId - team id from the contest system
 *   * orgFullName - fullName of team organization
 *   * orgDisplayName - displayName of team organization
 *   * all values from customFields
 *
 * @param startTime Override for contest start time.
 *        The preferred format is `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`, but some others would be accepted too.
 *        startTime override also can affect contest state.
 * @param contestLength Length of the contest. Also, can affect contest state.
 * @param freezeTime Time from the start of the contest before scoreboard freezing.
 * @param holdTime Fixed time to show as time before the contest start
 * @param teamOverrideTemplate Template for team overrides
 * @param teamNameRegexes Bunch of regexes to extract information cds doesn't provide from team name.
 * @param teamIdRegexes Bunch of regexes to extract information cds doesn't provide from team's ID.
 * @param teamOverrides Overrides for a specific team. Team id from the contest system is key.
 * @param groupOverrides Overrides for specific groups. Group name is key.
 * @param problemOverrides Overrides for specific problems. Problem id from the contest system is key.
 * @param scoreboardOverrides Overrides of scoreboard calculation settings
